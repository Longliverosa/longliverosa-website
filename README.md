# Long Live Rosa: Community Game Website

Welcome to the official website repository for **Long Live Rosa**—a community-driven, pixel-art puzzle-platformer inspired by Rosa the sea otter and the DougDoug community!

---

## 🦦 Who Are We?

We are the DougDoug Community, united by our love for Rosa the sea otter and the joy of creating together. Through our Discord server, we’ve come together to work collaboratively on the Long Live Rosa game—an entirely community-driven tribute built in pixel art using the Godot engine.

> **Note:**  
> There is no official involvement from DougDoug (or his collaborators), the Monterey Bay Aquarium, or any other organisation or authority.

## 🎯 The Goal

Together, as the DougDoug viewership community, we aim to collaboratively create a pixel-art 2D puzzle-platformer where players control Rosa the sea otter as the protagonist.

**Game Features:**
- **Puzzle-platformer mechanics:** Jump, swim, push and pull objects, navigate obstacles, and solve environmental challenges.
- **Pixel-art style:** Charming, handcrafted visuals created by the community.
- **Godot engine:** Chosen for its accessibility, strong 2D support, and vibrant community—making it an ideal platform for an open development process.

Levels are inspired by Rosa’s life and her habitat—swimming through kelp forests, rescuing stranded pups, solving ecological puzzles tied to kelp‑forest conservation, and celebrating her playful and caring spirit.

The Godot community regularly collaborates on multiplayer jams, open-source tools, and group projects, making it a perfect fit for our collaborative game development journey!
